\textbf{How to answer this exam}

\begin{itemize}
    \item There are a \textbf{total of 50 points}. There is a bonus question at the end (about Linear Temporal Logic worth 2 additional points)
    \item Read the questions twice. Sometimes, you answer something other than what is asked, so make sure you understand what it is I am asking for.
    \item Consider the following 4 principles for answering:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item \textbf{Correctness}: first and foremost, answer with truthful statements only.
        \item \textbf{Completeness}: check your answer to make sure you answered the whole question.
        \item \textbf{Clarity}: before answering, think about the structure of your response so that it is straightforward, simple, and it satisfies the two previous principles.
        \item \textbf{Conciseness}: longer is not better... it is in fact worse, so only answer what is asked for, in a simple way, and as long as it is correct and complete, it will be good enough.
    \end{itemize}

\textbf{IMPORTANT}: If I cannot read or see your answers (images too small or wording is confusing, I will take points away).
\end{itemize}

\begin{question}{0}\textbf{Getting in the Groove} (0 points)

Educational research studies\footnote{\scriptsize{Lang, Jonas WB, and Jessica Lang. ``Priming competence diminishes the link between cognitive test anxiety and test performance: Implications for the interpretation of test scores.'' \textit{Psychological Science} 21.6 (2010): 811-819.}}\footnote{\scriptsize{Barrows, Jennifer, Samantha Dunn, and Carrie A. Lloyd. ``Anxiety, self-efficacy, and college exam grades.'' \textit{Universal Journal of Educational Research} 1.3 (2013): 204-208.}} have suggested that people perform better on tests when they spend a few minutes thinking about things they're good at before they begin.\\\\
In the space below, briefly tell us about a time when you were \textbf{really successful} at doing something challenging (it doesn't have to be related to this course). If you prefer, you can draw a picture instead of writing.\\
