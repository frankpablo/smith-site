# Brief

I am a Lecturer in the Computer Science department at Smith College. I received my PhD. from the George Washington University under the direction of Professor Rahul Simha. I currently teach a variety of undergraduate courses and have taught graduate courses in the past.

My research is currently focused on STEM, especially on the areas of identifying misconceptions, creating scalable and informative assessments, and in the use of active learning techniques such as learning-by-teaching, and peer learning.

In addition, I work on Human-Computer Interaction and how it might allow us to interact with virtual worlds and robots.

I enjoy collaborating with colleagues in other fields where I get to combine CS with Biology or Physics and play with their data.

Topics of interest include:

*   Flipped Classroom techniques to teach programming
*   The benefits of games and puzzles in learning
*   Construction of fair, scalable assessments
*   Multimodal teaching with an emphasis on getting students to articulate their understanding
*   3D-Shape reconstruction and analysis
*   The use of Embedded Systems and Machine Learning to automate (Biology) Laboratory tasks.

### Extra below

This is a *bare-minimum* template to create a Jekyll site that uses the [Just the Docs] theme. You can easily set the created site to be published on [GitHub Pages] â€“ the [README] file explains how to do that, along with other details.

If [Jekyll] is installed on your computer, you can also build and preview the created site *locally*. This lets you test changes before committing them, and avoids waiting for GitHub Pages.[^1] And you will be able to deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages.

More specifically, the created site:

- uses a gem-based approach, i.e. uses a `Gemfile` and loads the `just-the-docs` gem
- uses the [GitHub Pages / Actions workflow] to build and publish the site on GitHub Pages

Other than that, you're free to customize sites that you create with this template, however you like. You can easily change the versions of `just-the-docs` and Jekyll it uses, as well as adding further plugins.

[Browse our documentation][Just the Docs] to learn more about how to use this theme.

To get started with creating a site, just click "[use this template]"!
