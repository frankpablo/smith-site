# SPEIR Description
Students frequently choose correct answers for incorrect reasons, leav- ing traditional formative assessments unable to surface the misconcep- tions that matter most for learning. We introduce Structured Post- Evaluation Interviews and Remediation (SPEIR), a workflow that ex- tends two-tier Justified Multiple-Choice Questions (JMCQs) with guided discussions and targeted recovery opportunities to surface and address those hidden misunderstandings. Implemented across ten course sec- tions and compared with a traditional MCQ control, SPEIR showed that correctness alone substantially overestimates understanding, while per-question analyses revealed higher rates of fully correct reasoning in SPEIR sections. Students who completed recovery quizzes demonstrated notable gains, and instructors reported that SPEIR enabled efficient, fo- cused feedback. These results suggest that SPEIR is a scalable approach for integrating diagnostic assessment with timely remediation.
