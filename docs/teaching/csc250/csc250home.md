**Research interests**: *Human-Robot Interaction, Robotic Perception, STEM education*

**Class Schedule**: Monday, Wednesday, Friday 9:25 AM -- 10:40 PM at Ford 342

Attendance is mandatory.

**Contact for Class stuff**: Use *Slack* (fastest), office hours (most
detailed), or can also email me (slowest).

**Office Hours**: 

  <!-- - TBD : Fill this ASAP: [5-minute intro poll](https://www.when2meet.com/?23288198-ImNca) -->

  - Wednesday 3:15 PM to 4:15 PM Ford 316 or the Study Nook next to Ford 322 (both shown below).
  - Friday 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM Ford 316 or the Study Nook next to Ford 322 (both shown below).

**Office Hour Rules**:

  * I like office hours! so please come and chat with me about how your doing and to clarify concepts from the class. That said, and since I have a limited amount of time for OHs, it is best if we're a bit organized:
  * Try before asking: Try the problem or research the concept you have an issue with (at least a little) before asking about it. That let's you get a better view of the problem, ask better questions, and often leads to finding the solution.
  * Check Slack: Check the thread for the lecture/assignment in which you have an issue and see if someone already asked/answered what you need help with
  * Bring questions prepared: Once you know what you need help with, it is best to write down the questions you want to ask and to have the materials ready (slides/assignment/...)
  * If you and a group of people want to review a topic, agree to meet up and attend office hours together. Group office hours is often better because more people means more questions answered!
  * "open office hours" (TBD) are available to everyone, in groups or individually. 
  * "appointment slots" (TBD) are by request (usually reserved for 1-on-1 and to deal with acute issues)
  * If you solve your question before a scheduled appointment, cancel the appointment. No-Shows are bad!
  * Show up on time! and Have your question/program ready, otherwise your time will not be enough.
  * You cant book an appointment fewer than 2 hours before the desired time.

Note: if you have a non-conceptual question and you wanna ask/chat about it, you are also welcome!... no need to "prep questions" in that case.

## Objectives and Structure 


**Objectives**

This course provides a challenging introduction to some of the core theoretical ideas that underlie the computational sciences. The objective of this course is:

  * To develop an understanding of "computer science outside the box" -- to begin to think of CS not only as the science of computers, but as the science of what can be computed.
  * Demonstrate familiarity with key concepts in logic, proofs, and the definitions of multiple computational paradigms.
  * Explain core computer science topics, such as automata, grammars, Turing machines, complexity, and more
  * Propose algorithms in order to transform and analyze problems using the tools and structures we will develop in class

**Effort Expectations**: This class has the expectation that you have mathematical maturity and programming experience, but most imporrtantly: that you can devote the time to the necessary work and study to do well in class. The course is a 4-credit course, which means you should expect to work around **12 hours per week**. 

The recommended distribution is: 

  * approximately 4 hours of class time
  * approximately 5 hours every week on homework assignments
  * approximately 3 hours every week reading or studying (before and after class).

If you follow this general routine, the class should not be too challenging. If you do not follow this time investment, you will feel accumulating pressure. 

Summary: Please put the time in to make sure you don't feel unnecessary stress.  

**Content**: 

  * We'll begin with very simple computational machinery (automata and finite state machines, regular sets, context-free languages).
  * We'll then move on to Turing machines and computability, efficient algorithms and reducibility, NP-completeness, the P versus NP problem, the power of randomness.
  * We'll draw on real world examples from the domains of cryptography, machine learning, and more.
  * Finally, we'll talk about the present and future of computing theory, with potential topics including interactive proofs, quantum computing and the physical limits of computation.

**Class mechanics**:

  * We will discuss concepts using blackboard annotations as well as proyected presentations, animations, and videos;
  * Optional readings will be available and are recommended material before each designated lecture. This will help prepare you for the day's discussion.
  * Friday classes will be used to practice the techniques seen during the week by solving exercises and discussing subjects that remain confusing. Note: class participation is important, as the class will include discussion and debate about many of these topics.

**Assignments**:

There will be 6 to 8 problem sets assigned during the semester.

These problem sets will often ask you to prove theorems, but it is more important to demonstrate understanding than to employ rigor for rigor's sake. For example: a brief description of an algorithm including an illustrative diagram is better than complicated spaghetti code. Additionally, a clear explanation of how you tried to solve a problem and were unsuccessful will receive partial credit.

Use the following checklist to guide your answers:

  1. Is my answer Correct? (if not, re work it until you find the correct answer)
  2. Is my answer Complete? (if not, explore corner cases and possible gaps in your logic)
  3. is my answer Concise? (if not, find a way to explain it in fewer words/steps)
  4. Is my answer Clear? (if not, re word it or add an illustration that clarifies your meaning)

If I can't understand what you mean, an answer that is hard to read (because it is to complicated or long) might get a bad grade even if it happens to be correct and complete! Always rework your answers to satisfy points 3 and 4!

All assignment submissions must be in PDF format, and must be organized and legible (typed is preferable). A LaTeX template is available for typesetting your assignments.

## Prerequisites and Student Responsibilities 

**Prerequisites**:

  * CSC110 (or CSC111) and MTH153. The latter may be taken concurrently with permission of the instructor. Most importantly, I will assume you have basic "mathematical maturity": i.e., that you are comfortable both reading and writing mathematical proofs.

**Responsibilities**:

  * Attendance: You should attend all classes unless you have a valid excuse. I will use Google forms to take attendance/run quizzes at least once a week. Unexcused missed classes mean a loss of points in "Attendance and Participation".
  * Interact, ask questions, and generally participate in class discussions.
  * Complete the assigned preliminary readings and activities before each lecture.
  * Complete problems individually unless working in a group as specified on the assignment in which case you can work only with those group members. We do plagiarism detection so don't throw the course away.
  * When working with a group, it is essential that each group member pull their own weight, but also that other group members let them do so!


**Course Philosophies**

Throughout the class, students should focus on adhering to the following general tenets:

  * Try it! -- A common question is "will this work?", or "what will happen in this case?". The only reasonable answer is "try it and see!".
  * It is OK to make mistakes! -- an error is one learned lesson. After trying something, having that fail is as much a datapoint as a correct path. Note that we usually want correct paths after exploring and making a lot of errors so keep looking!
  * Ask for help when stuck! -- if you have 1) tried multiple paths and 2) you have explored the problem and made many mistakes, and you are still stuck, please seek assistance! that's what were here for! Believe it or not, we actually like teaching and helping you make progress.
  * Know your sources, and use them! -- We'll use Sipser's book and you can look for other online courses to support your learning. Be careful with online materials (like tutorials or articles): they are not necessarily correct! Learn to use your sources productively to help to make progress.
  * Be proud of your submissions! -- Clarity above all. Use proper styling, simplify it where you can to make it more understandable, and comment it where appropriate. You're taking part in an art that most often is shared, and it matters if others can understand your work!
  * Planning is the best problem-solving tool! -- You should not jump into writing solutions or writing code before thinking about it thoroughly. Design your solutions by breaking them into logical parts that make sense independently and when put together to make an argument.
  * Practice methodical analysis! -- Spend time "stepping though" your proofs and solutions, statement by statement to understand the logic behind them, and why it is logically sound (or why it was marked as incorrect). Do not submit a solution that you don't fully understand with the hope of flying under the radar. We look deeply at your submissions to gauge your level of understanding.

## Grading

<!-- 
The following grade calculation may be modified slightly depending on how the semester progresses

  - Attendance and Participation : 10%
     - Attendance: measured with in-class quizzes/exercises
     - Participation: in-class/OHs/Demo participation
  - Homework Assignments (10 problem sets): 50%
     - Each worth 5%
         - Graded During Friday classes in a 5 minute demo.
         - Must present using the submitted pdf Latex document
         - Every team member must be able to explain any problem
  - Test/Assignment 1: 20%
  - Test/Assignment 2: 20%


**Notes**: Completing the in-class quizzes/exercises will be used as an attendance metric; 
Participation will be actually graded based on my memory of your active involvement in
Class/Office-Hours/Slack.
 -->

**Grade Calculation**:

(The following grade calculation may be modified slightly depending on how the semester progresses)

  - Homework Assignments: **35%**
  - Weekly Quiz Grades: **10%**
  - Quiz completion (regardless of grade) **5%**
  - Attendance **10%**
  - Participation **10%**
         - in-class Q/A (just ask questions!!)
         - OHs/Slack Q/A
         - attend talks/events
         - answer polls/surveys
  - Midterm Exam:     **10%**
  - Final Exam:     **10%**
  - Presentations:  **10%**

**Note**: Any changes in grading will be explained in class and will only be made to benefit the students and fit any refinements done during the semester.


**Quizzes**:

We will have one quiz per subject (usually once a week). There are two ways in which we'll use quizzes: 

  1. we will use them to record attendance (quizzes will be done on your laptops but will be password protected to avoid temptation of solving them outside of class).
  2. we will obtain grades from them to try to identify misconceptions and recurring errors. 

**Late Submissions**:

We will accept no late submissions without a valid excuse (see exceptions). Failing to finish a homework on time excludes you from the active grading exercise where much of the actual learning happens. Submitting "what you were able to get done" is better than nothing. 

Also, for Office Hours, you must show progress up to the point where you got stuck. 

*Exceptions*: 

That said, we will have the following "stress release" policies in place:

  - If you have a justification (like a medical one), you get an extension depending on what makes most sense.
  - If you are overwhelmed come talk to me before the due date and we will find a solution.

**Recovery options**:

We will have a few ways of alleviating grade pressure:

  * Discarding the worst HW: the worst in the first few homework assignments (all but the last 2) will be discarded.

  * Discarding the worst quiz: the worst in the first few quizzes (all but the last 2) will be discarded.

  <!-- * The second Test/Assignment (Final Exam) will have questions similar to that of the first Test/Assignment (Midterm). If students improve their score on *those part-1 questions*, points back will be awarded to their score in Test/Assignment 1. This means that restudying to do better is actively rewarded. -->


**Collaborations**:

  * Students are strongly encouraged to form study groups and to collaborate on problem sets, though each student team of 3 will be required to write up and submit their solutions independently and to **report the names of their collaborators** (or lose points). The following information is required for all submitted work:

     1. The names of all collaborating students be listed at the top of the submission. 
     2. A "References" section, with in-line citations to any resources you used. Citations should include page numbers (if a printed resource) or a direct URL (if an online resource). If you did not use any resources in completing the assignment, please state: "I did not utilize any external resources in completing this assignment."

**Accommodations**:

As individuals, we learn in different ways. I try to vary the activities used during the course to suit a variety of learning patterns, and I am always open for suggestions. Please come talk to me if you have an idea that will make the course more accessible to you and/or other students. If you need special accommodation, like extended exam time, please submit requests for accommodations in writing with proof of College support from the Office of Disabilities Service within the first two weeks of class. Let me know if you need help with this process.


## Academic Honesty

Team assignments require collaboration amidst each team, but no
collaboration between teams is permitted. If you did not work in a team
then you are not allowed to collaborate on the homework assignments. We
use software to compare submissions, so please don't risk it. If
you're having significant trouble with an assignment, please contact
me.

Please check the [Student
Handbook](https://www.smith.edu/about-smith/offices/student-affairs/student-handbook)
to see the rules for Academic Integrity.

Just as you can do a google search for code online, it is trivial for us
to do the same. If you feel pressured about an assignment, please come
see me instead of cheating.

## Comments from previous semesters

  
  * I would absolutely encourage a student to take this course. I learned so much and I found the material so interesting. I think that the technical aspects of the class can be challenging so I would encourage the student to stay on top of that part and to use your conceptual understanding and intuition to help. Overall, I’m really glad I had the opportunity to take this class.
  * Go. To. Office. Hours.
  * Show up to class, allow yourself to be confused, and then go to office hours with a million questions.
  * This class is hard! It's very mathy and proof heavy, there is NO CODING in this class. Definitely work with your peers on the homeworks and use Office Hours and TA hours! If you reread the slides and pay attention in class you'll be good –– PAY ATTENTION IN CLASS!
  * The topics in this course can be tricky to understand, but go to office hours. *Go to office hours!* And ask a lot of questions. \[The instructor\] will help you, and in time, things will (most likely) click. You got this!
  * Please TAKE IT!!!!
  * ASK questions!!! \[The instructor\] loves asnwering questions. If you don't understand ASK. Otherwise you will be stuck.
  * Go to office hours, do homework carefully, and take notes in class.
  * Work in groups on the hw assignments and start them early so you have time to get stuck
  * Watch Youtube videos before coming to class, they are a life saver. Specifically shorter Youtube videos. Some good channels are Easy Theory and lydia and UC Computer Science Education. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GfCvyRyiR34
  * It's definitely a lot of work, so be prepared for that. \[The instructor\] is a great professor and really wants you to succeed. He's willing to work with you to make sure you're learning and doing well. Definitely make sure you understand the topics really well because the quizzes and exams can be tricky.
  * Remain consistent with the effort you put in this class, it will pay off.
  * I would highly recommend office hours and reading the material before class.
  * Make sure you ask questions and engage during class. I know that a lot of people don't do the readings and I understand that, but I think that just skimming them is enough to be helpful. \[The instructor\] is very helpful during office hours and very responsive to questions, so take advantage of that.
  * – Go to office hours!
  * This course is conceptually challenging, especially during the second half, but I learned a lot. I would definitely suggest that students work in pairs on their homework. This was very helpful for me. Take your time on the homework because this is where a lot of my learning took place. The homework assignments helped the concepts click for me. Also engaging in class discussion was helpful to my learning.
  * Making the most of your resources and not being afraid to ask questions.
  * Never hesitate to ask questions when you get stuck.


# Q & A

  * Q: **When are the instructor's office hours?**
      * A: TBD (we'll define them using a poll and set 2 x 1-hour sessions; in addition, we can always meet over zoom with prior arangement or discuss over Slack).
  * Q: **Where are office hours?**
      * A: Ford Hall, Third Floor, Chemistry side, to the end: Office #316
  * Q: **What can I do if I am not free during office hours?**
      * A: we can set up an appointment to meet over zoom (usually 10 min). Also, there will be TA help available (TBD).
  * Q: **When are the TA's office hours?**
      * A: TBD.
  * Q: **Can I submit Homework Assignments late?**
      * A: Only with prior permission (Slack) given an explanation or because of emergency (e.g. health); HWs build on each other so the maximum extension is 4 days.
  * Q: **Can I complete a quiz late?**
      * A: Only with prior permission (Slack) given an explanation or because of emergency (e.g. health); Quizzes are used for attendance AND formative assessments so you only get 1 free late attempt.      
  * Q: **Will you record classes?**
      * A: Only the first two weeks. 
  * Q: **Can I "attend" classes over Zoom?**
      * A: Only due to health reasons and with previous permission from the instructor. In addition, the instroctor will not manage the zoom call so you need to get a classmate to: 1) sit in front, and 2) manage the zoom call and your questions. I can lend that person a webcam for easy setup.     
  * Q: **What do I need to get started?**
      * A: Access to the [website](https://frankpablo.github.io/smith-site/docs/teaching/csc250home/), access to moodle for the course, access to the Slack workspace for the course.
  * Q: **What do I do if I am not officially registered (I don't have Moodle)?**
      * A: The course has a cap, and only if students leave will I let other students in. I will pick students based on the waitlist with no preference given to anyone.

**Class mechanics**:

  * We will discuss concepts using blackboard annotations as well as proyected presentations and animations;
  * Readings will be assigned and should be completed before each designated lecture. This will help prepare you for the day's discussion.
  * Friday classes will be used to practice the techniques seen during the week by solving exercises and discussing subjects that remain confusing. Note: class participation is important, as the class will include discussion and debate about many of these topics.

  * Planning is the best problem-solving tool! -- You should not jump into writing solutions or writing code before thinking about it thoroughly. Design your solutions by breaking them into logical parts that make sense independently and when put together to make an argument.
  * Practice methodical analysis! -- Spend time "stepping though" your proofs and solutions, statement by statement to understand the logic behind them, and why it is logically sound (or why it was marked as incorrect). Do not submit a solution that you don't fully understand with the hope of flying under the radar. We look deeply at your submissions to gauge your level of understanding.

## Course Materials

-   **Moodle**: Course full name "CSC250-01: Theory of Computation"
-   **Slack**: You\'ll receive an invitation to the workspace:
    *csc-250-01-202303.slack.com*


**Books:**

There is no required textbook for the course. However, there are several recommended books that some students may find helpful:

  * Sipser, Michael.  [Introduction to the Theory of Computation](https://openlibrary.org/search?q=Introduction+to+the+theory+of+computation&mode=everything). Course Technology, 2006. ISBN: 9780534950972. (Note: there is a newer edition available, but it is not necessary - the 2nd edition will suffice.)
  * Moore, Cristopher and Stephan Mertens. [The Nature of Computation](http://nature-of-computation.org/). Oxford University Press, 2011. ISBN: 9780199233212.
  * Arora, Sanjeev and Boaz Barak. [Computational Complexity: A Modern Approach](http://theory.cs.princeton.edu/complexity/). Cambridge University Press, 2009. ISBN: 9780521424264.

## Grading


The following grade calculation may be modified slightly depending on how the semester progresses

  - Attendance and Participation : 10%
     - Attendance: measured with in-class quizzes/exercises
     - Participation: in-class/OHs/Demo participation
  - Homework Assignments (10 problem sets): 50%
     - Each worth 5%
         - Graded During Friday classes in a 5 minute demo.
         - Must present using the submitted pdf Latex document
         - Every team member must be able to explain any problem
  - Test/Assignment 1: 20%
  - Test/Assignment 2: 20%


**Notes**: Completing the in-class quizzes/exercises will be used as an attendance metric; 
Participation will be actually graded based on my memory of your active involvement in
Class/Office-Hours/Slack.

**HW Grading**: The Demo will count 25% of your grade and I will base it mostly on your presentation of the answers. Then, I will give you live feedback AND let you submit a corrected version of the Homework due the following Monday.

**Late Submissions**:

We will accept no late submissions without a valid excuse (see exceptions). The homework and projects are designed to have "checkpoints" so that you MUST show your progress at every point so starting late is actively discouraged. 

Also, for Office Hours, you must show progress up to the point where you got stuck. 

*Exceptions*: 

That said, we will have the following "stress release" policies in place:

  - If you have a justification (like a medical one), you get an extension depending on what makes most sense.
  - If you are simply overwhelmed and simply need more time: Each student gets 1 free 2-day extension, no questions asked. but you must let me know at least 24 hours before the due date/time. After that, you may request 1-day extensions on a per-case basis; Do not take these for granted, they will be awarded sparingly.

**Dropped assignments and Points-back policies**:

We will have two ways of alleviating grade pressure:

  * Discarding the bad: the worst in the first few homework assignments (all but the last 2) will be discarded.

  * HW points back: Students that want to obtain points back for a single problem in the previous HW assignment, can choose to add it at the end of the new HW and explain it during the demo.

  * The second Test/Assignment will have questions similar to that of the first Test/Assignment. If students improve their score on *those part-1 questions*, points back will be awarded to their score in Test/Assignment 1. This means that restudying to do better is actively awarded.


**Collaborations**:

  * Students are strongly encouraged to form study groups and to collaborate on problem sets, though each student team of 3 will be required to write up and submit their solutions independently. The following information is required for all submitted work:

     1. The names of all collaborating students be listed at the top of the submission (All groups will be of size 3 except one). 
     2. A "References" section, with in-line citations to any resources you used. Citations should include page numbers (if a printed resource) or a direct URL (if an online resource). If you did not use any resources in completing the assignment, please state: "I did not utilize any external resources in completing this assignment."

**Accommodations**:

As individuals, we learn in different ways. I try to vary the activities used during the course to suit a variety of learning patterns, and I am always open for suggestions. Please come talk to me if you have an idea that will make the course more accessible to you and/or other students. If you need special accommodation, like extended exam time, please submit requests for accommodations in writing with proof of College support from the Office of Disabilities Service within the first two weeks of class. Let me know if you need help with this process.


## Academic Honesty

Team assignments require collaboration amidst each team, but no
collaboration between teams is permitted. If you did not work in a team
then you are not allowed to collaborate on the homework assignments. We
use software to compare submissions, so please don't risk it. If
you're having significant trouble with an assignment, please contact
me.

Please check the [Student
Handbook](https://www.smith.edu/about-smith/offices/student-affairs/student-handbook)
to see the rules for Academic Integrity.

Just as you can do a google search for code online, it is trivial for us
to do the same. If you feel pressured about an assignment, please come
see me instead of cheating.
