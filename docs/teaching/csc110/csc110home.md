## Objectives and Structure 

CSC 110 is a gentle introduction to designing programs (recipes) for systematically solving
problems. Students will learn to build programs including designing, coding,
debugging, testing and documenting them. An introduction to block-structured
procedural control flow including branching, iteration, and functions, using
primitive and simple data types (lists). Students will understand the high level 
internal operation of computer systems (inputs, outputs, processing,
and storage) and their application. Students will be exposed to the social and
historical aspects of computing. This course is recommended for those who have
no prior experience in computer science at the high school, AP, or college level.

**Objectives** - In completing this class, students will...

-   Create and document computer programs using correct Python syntax
    that can be readily understood and used by other programmers.
-   Propose algorithms in order to analyze problems that use basic
    control flow constructs (e.g., if-then statements, loops, functions,
    lists, simple input-output).
-   Demonstrate foundational development techniques, including top-down
    design, program documentation, modular design, and library usage.
<!--     
-   Understand the high-level internal operation of a computer,
    including the central processing unit, simple memory management.
 -->

**Setting Expectations**: This class is an introductory class. This means it is designed to start with little to no prior experience and cover the basics. This does not mean it is necessarily easy. The course is a 4-credit course, which means you should expect to work around **12 hours per week**. 

The recommended distribution is: 

  * approximately 4 hours of class time
  * approximately 5 hours every week on homework assignments
  * approximately 3 hours every week reading or studying (before and after class).

If you follow this general routine, the class should not be too challenging and it will tend to "feel" easy. If you do not follow this time investment, you will feel accumulating pressure. 

Summary: Please put the time in to make sure you don't feel unnecessary stress.


**Course Topics**: In CSC110 we will cover the following topics, but not necessarily in
this order):

  - Components of a computer at an abstract level (i.e., input, output, storage, computation) and physical level (i.e., hard drive, CPU, keyboard, etc.)
  - Functions
  - Conditionals, Math Operators, Logical Operators
  - Loops and Iteration
  - Variables and Data Types
  - Strings
  - Lists
  - Dictionaries
  - Basic Graphics 
  - Reading and Writing to Files Storage 
  - User inputs and print formatting
  - Intro to the concept of an algorithm (e.g, as a recipe)

In addition to these core programming concepts, we will also work on some soft skills:

  - Programing problem solving
  - File systems (e.g., files, storage as bytes) and the cloud
  - Pair programming
  - Doc strings and commenting code
  - Testing code (esp. thinking of edge cases)
  - Debugging and tracing code
  - Designing a program (e.g., software development methodologies)
  - Impacts and applications of Computing (e.g., social, ethical, historical)
  - Pseudocode 101



## Prerequisites and Student Responsibilities 

This course is recommended for those who have
no prior experience in computer science at the high school, AP, or college level.
Not open to students who have taken CSC 111. May not be taken concurrently
with CSC 120.

**Prerequisites**: *This course does not have any prerequisites*. In this class, we will not
assume that you have prior computer science or programming experience.
If initially you find the pace of class too slow and homework too easy,
then you are invited to help your peers in the lab, until everyone has
caught up to your prior experience. To this end, everyone is expected to
respect and honor the unique perspectives each participant brings to
this course and work to help one another.

**Responsibilities**:

  -  **Attendance**: You should attend all classes unless you have a valid excuse. I will use Moodle/Qualtrics Quizzes and Google forms to take attendance at least once a week. Unexcused missed classes mean a loss of points in "Attendance and Participation".
  - **START EARLY**: the hardest part of any assignment is starting it. This is doubly so in programming, since the assignments have a lot of instructions and moving parts. I recommend starting assignments the same day they are issued so that you "break the ice". I promise that if you develop this habit, you will see the results immediately.
  - **Communication**: The college and your instructor will really try to be there for you. We want you to succeed and enjoy your experience. To do so, we need to know how you are doing. So: please see me in office hours, participate in class (asking questions is the best way!), and keep an eye out for discussions on Slack. 


## Course Materials

-   **Moodle**: Course full name "CSC110-05: Introduction to Computer Science"
-   **PythonAnywhere** (PA): PA is a cloud based platform that allows the creation,
    assigning, completion, testing, and grading (manually) of
    programming assignments. You need to register for it (you\'ll
    receive an invitation from the instructor) so you can complete
    readings, exercises, and assignments.
-   **Slack**: You\'ll receive an invitation to the workspace:
    *CSC-110-01-202403*
-   **Online Book**: We'll use the book **How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Interactive Edition** (**FREE**) for readings and exercises. The book is linked to a Runestone Academy "course" called **smithcollege_thinkcspy_s24**. The instructions for registering are found in Moodle.


**Books:**

You do not need to buy any textbook to be successful. The readings will be from free online sources.
Below are textbooks that you may want to review as a resource and some
students have found helpful in the past:

  1.  [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Interactive Edition](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/index.html) (**FREE**) . Runestone Interactive Project at Luther College, led by Brad Miller and David Ranum. 
  2.  [Think Python; 2nd edition (2015)](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/thinkpython2.pdf). Allen B. Downey. ISBN: 978-1491939369 (Note: eBook available for **FREE**).
  3.  [Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer
    Science](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Programming-Introduction-Computer-Science/dp/1590282752). John M. Zelle.
    Franklin, Beedle & Associates; 3rd edition (August 8, 2016). ISBN:
    978-1590282755 (Note: This is the newer edition, but the 2nd
    edition is also fine as a reference)


The Downey and Zelle books have been put on course reserve at the Library. If you need help covering the cost of textbooks or other academic supplies (for this or any of your courses!) please fill out the Academic Funding Application found at
[socialnetwork.smith.edu/forms](http://socialnetwork.smith.edu/forms)
(you must login before the forms will appear).


## Course Dynamics

In this course, the best way to learn is by applying the concepts into exercises and projects. 
We will therefore try to reduce the "lecture" time and increase the "practice" time in every class. To achieve this,  we will have students read before every class. Readings are compulsory and are necessary to be able to achieve the objectives in every class. The readings will have exercises which will form part of your grades. 

The first class of every week will start with a concept quiz (~10 minutes) where we will ask about concepts from the previous week's readings and activities. Monday and Wednesday classes will include concept recaps, Q&A, and some exercises to nail down the concepts, whicle Friday classes will mostly focus on in-class labs (longer exercises).

Attendance is extremely important. You should always inform the teacher before missing a class (through direct Slack message) and schedule an OHs meeting before returning to the next class.

Individual work will comprise most of the assignments but you will have at least two group projects, including the final project.


## Grading

The final grade for this course is S/U (Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory);
However, the way we will obtain this grade will be by running a "Normal" 
grading scheme and converting grades the following way:

  - 0% to 69.9% : Unsatisfactory
  - 70% to 100% : Satisfactory


**Grade Calculation**:

(The following grade calculation may be modified slightly depending on how the semester progresses)

  - Homework Assignments: **25%**
  - Weekly Quiz Grades: **20%**
  - Weekly Book Exercises: **10%** 
  - Attendance **10%**
  - Quiz/Book-Exercise completion **5%**
  - Participation **10%**
         - in-class Q/A (just ask questions!!)
         - OHs/Slack Q/A
         - attend talks/events
         - answer polls/surveys
  - Final Project:  **20%**


**Late Submissions**:

We will accept no late submissions without a valid excuse. 
The homework and projects are designed to have "checkpoints" so that you MUST show your progress at every point. Most homework assignments have "tests" that let you see exactly what is missing. If you have a valid excuse, then you will be granted small extensions.

Also, for Office Hours, you must show progress up to the point where you got stuck. 

**Accommodations**:

As individuals, we learn in different ways. I try to vary the activities
used during the course to suit a variety of learning patterns, and I am
always open for suggestions. Please come talk to me if you have an idea
that will make the course more accessible to you and/or other students.
If you need special accommodation, like extended exam time, please
submit requests for accommodations in writing with proof of College
support from the Office of Disabilities Service within the first two
weeks of class. Let me know if you need help with this process.


## Academic Honesty

Team assignments require collaboration amidst each team, but no
collaboration between teams is permitted without explicit permission. If you did not work in a team then you are not allowed to collaborate on the homework assignments. We use software to compare submissions, so please don't risk it. If
you're having significant trouble with an assignment, please contact me.

Please check the [Student
Handbook](https://www.smith.edu/about-smith/offices/student-affairs/student-handbook) to see the rules for Academic Integrity.

Just as you can do a google search for code online, it is trivial for us
to do the same. If you feel pressured about an assignment, please come
see me instead of cheating.

## Comments from previous semesters

  * I would say to a student who is considering taking it in the future to definitely take this class \[...\]. Walking into CSC110, I was worried that I wouldn't be able to grasp computer science concepts, and was worried that it'd be very difficult, but the class is extremely fun. Moreover, the professor is happy to be there, which boosts the environment of the class, and it also creates a class where students are excited to show up to class. The workload isn't too harsh, but I think the readings definitely help the course, as I write down the definition of terms when doing the readings, which greatly aided my memorization of concepts. The concepts are implemented well within the classes, so the coding doesn't feel too difficult or like a reach, but also tests the students' knowledge on each section. I would recommend doing the homework as soon as it's published, as it's nice to not be rushed and go to office hours to understand the concepts peacefully. Furthermore, \[the instructor\] emphasizes planning out your code before you start typing, which has been a great help, and provides a strong foundation for those who aim to continue in computer science.
  * When \[the instructor\] says plan before coding – do it
  * Do your reading, it is necessary for understanding what is being taught in class. Going to office hours is really helpful and I recommend just getting your homework/projects done there so you can ask questions as they come up. Following up on class activities in office hours is also helpful to furthering your understanding of the topics gone over in class.
make sure to start your work ahead of time and don't be afraid to go to office hours/TA hours!
  * I would advise a future student to take advantage of office hours! It is very useful to receive feedback from your professor and, especially with computer science, to get help with debugging.
  * Challenge yourself the way you used to "think" and try position yourself in our friend–computer's shoes.
  * I would recommend future students to really pay attention and do the in class activities since I feel like they really helped with the final project.
  * Please attend classes and office hours
  * Don't procrastinate on the homeworks. Start them early so you can go to TA hours. Pick something that you really like, so you're not hating yourself by the end of the course.
  * If you need clarification on materials taught in class, do the reading. it will help you to learn it fully. even though the materail is repeated in class it is always good to relearn and refresh
  * This is a fun and rewarding course. To get the most out of this class, make sure to participate and ask questions. Help is always available if you need it and ask for it.
  * Ask questions,! The earlier, the better
  * I would recommend to get ahead of work early rather than wait till the last second and to not be afraid to ask as many questions as needed.
  * Take it. It is worth it! it might be challenging at the beginning to figure out what is going on but make sure to ask for help!!!
  * PLAN! Always plan ahead on paper, never just start coding, unless you want to fall into the pit of doom. And go to office hours, they are very helpful!!
  * Don't get discouraged immediately. Things blow up with python, but see it as a good thing: you are getting feedback and using logic you can debug. I never thought I would be a coder, and even now I'm not fluent in python, but it's much more important to go in with the mindset that you will take away other things from this course. Such as how to reason and think logically/mathematically, how to plan, teamwork, etc. a lot of transferable skils.
  * do the reading, listen to the examples in class. if you feel like you are behind schedules, ask your partner or peers, go to \[the instructor\]'s office hour
  * start everything early and pay attention in class even if something doesn't seem super important. it will be important later
