## Objectives and Structure 

CSC 110 is a gentle introduction to designing programs (recipes) for systematically solving
problems. Students will learn to build programs including designing, coding,
debugging, testing and documenting them. An introduction to block-structured
procedural control flow including branching, iteration, and functions, using
primitive and simple data types (lists). Students will understand the high level 
internal operation of computer systems (inputs, outputs, processing,
and storage) and their application. Students will be exposed to the social and
historical aspects of computing. This course is recommended for those who have
no prior experience in computer science at the high school, AP, or college level.

**Objectives** - In completing this class, students will...

-   Create and document computer programs using correct Python syntax
    that can be readily understood and used by other programmers.
-   Propose algorithms in order to analyze problems that use basic
    control flow constructs (e.g., if-then statements, loops, functions,
    lists, simple input-output).
-   Demonstrate foundational development techniques, including top-down
    design, program documentation, modular design, and library usage.
<!--     
-   Understand the high-level internal operation of a computer,
    including the central processing unit, simple memory management.
 -->

**Setting Expectations**: This class is an introductory class. This means it is designed to start with little to no prior experience and cover the basics. This does not mean it is necessarily easy. The course is a 4-credit course, which means you should expect to work around **12 hours per week**. 

The recommended distribution is: 

  * approximately 4 hours of class time
  * approximately 5 hours every week on homework assignments
  * approximately 3 hours every week reading or studying (before and after class).

If you follow this general routine, the class should not be too challenging and it will tend to "feel" easy. If you do not follow this time investment, you will feel accumulating pressure. 

Summary: Please put the time in to make sure you don't feel unnecessary stress.


**Course Topics**: In CSC110 we will cover the following topics, but not necessarily in
this order):

  - Components of a computer at an abstract level (i.e., input, output, storage, computation) and physical level (i.e., hard drive, CPU, keyboard, etc.)
  - Functions
  - Conditionals, Math Operators, Logical Operators
  - Loops and Iteration
  - Variables and Data Types
  - Strings
  - Lists
  - Dictionaries
  - Basic Graphics 
  - Reading and Writing to Files Storage 
  - User inputs and print formatting
  - Intro to the concept of an algorithm (e.g, as a recipe)

In addition to these core programming concepts, we will also work on some soft skills:

  - Programing problem solving
  - File systems (e.g., files, storage as bytes) and the cloud
  - Pair programming
  - Doc strings and commenting code
  - Testing code (esp. thinking of edge cases)
  - Debugging and tracing code
  - Designing a program (e.g., software development methodologies)
  - Impacts and applications of Computing (e.g., social, ethical, historical)
  - Pseudocode 101



## Prerequisites and Student Responsibilities 

This course is recommended for those who have
no prior experience in computer science at the high school, AP, or college level.
Not open to students who have taken CSC 111. May not be taken concurrently
with CSC 120.

**Prerequisites**: *This course does not have any prerequisites*. In this class, we will not
assume that you have prior computer science or programming experience.
If initially you find the pace of class too slow and homework too easy,
then you are invited to help your peers in the lab, until everyone has
caught up to your prior experience. To this end, everyone is expected to
respect and honor the unique perspectives each participant brings to
this course and work to help one another.

**Responsibilities**:

  -  **Attendance**: You should attend all classes unless you have a valid excuse. I will use Moodle/Qualtrics Quizzes and Google forms to take attendance at least once a week. Unexcused missed classes mean a loss of points in "Attendance and Participation".
  - **START EARLY**: the hardest part of any assignment is starting it. This is doubly so in programming, since the assignments have a lot of instructions and moving parts. I recommend starting assignments the same day they are issued so that you "break the ice". I promise that if you develop this habit, you will see the results immediately.
  - **Communication**: The college and your instructor will really try to be there for you. We want you to succeed and enjoy your experience. To do so, we need to know how you are doing. So: please see me in office hours, participate in class (asking questions is the best way!), and keep an eye out for discussions on Slack. 


## Course Materials

-   **Moodle**: Course full name "CSC110-05: Introduction to Computer Science"
-   **Repl.it**: Repl.it is a cloud based platform that allows the creation,
    assigning, completion, testing, and grading (manual or automatic) of
    programming assignments. You need to register for it (you\'ll
    receive an invitation from the instructor) so you can complete
    readings, exercises, and assignments.
-   **Slack**: You\'ll receive an invitation to the workspace:
    *CSC-110-05-202401*


**Books:**

You do not need to buy any textbook to be successful. The readings will be from free online sources.
Below are textbooks that you may want to review as a resource and some
students have found helpful in the past:

  1.  [How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Interactive Edition](https://runestone.academy/ns/books/published/thinkcspy/index.html) (**FREE**) . Runestone Interactive Project at Luther College, led by Brad Miller and David Ranum. 
  2.  [Think Python; 2nd edition (2015)](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/thinkpython2.pdf). Allen B. Downey. ISBN: 978-1491939369 (Note: eBook available for **FREE**).
  3.  [Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer
    Science](https://www.amazon.com/Python-Programming-Introduction-Computer-Science/dp/1590282752). John M. Zelle.
    Franklin, Beedle & Associates; 3rd edition (August 8, 2016). ISBN:
    978-1590282755 (Note: This is the newer edition, but the 2nd
    edition is also fine as a reference)


The Downey and Zelle books have been put on course reserve at the Library. If you need help covering the cost of textbooks or other academic supplies (for this or any of your courses!) please fill out the Academic Funding Application found at
[socialnetwork.smith.edu/forms](http://socialnetwork.smith.edu/forms)
(you must login before the forms will appear).


## Grading

The final grade for this course is S/U (Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory);
However, the way we will obtain this grade will be by running a "Normal" 
grading scheme and converting grades the following way:

  - 0% to 69.9% : Unsatisfactory
  - 70% to 100% : Satisfactory


**Grade Calculation**:

(The following grade calculation may be modified slightly depending on how the semester progresses)

  - Homework Assignments: **30%**
  - Attendance and Participation **20%**
     - Quiz completion (10%)
     - participation (10%)
         - in-class Q/A (just ask questions!!)
         - OHs/Slack Q/A
         - attend talks/events
         - answer polls/surveys
  - Weekly Quiz Grades: **20%**
  - Final Exam:     **10%**
  - Final Project:  **20%**


**Late Submissions**:

We will accept no late submissions without a valid excuse. 
The homework and projects are designed to have "checkpoints"
so that you MUST show your progress at every point. Most homework assignments have "tests" that let you see exactly what is missing. If you have a valid excuse, then you will be granted small extensions.

Also, for Office Hours, you must show progress up to the point where you got stuck. 

**Accommodations**:

As individuals, we learn in different ways. I try to vary the activities
used during the course to suit a variety of learning patterns, and I am
always open for suggestions. Please come talk to me if you have an idea
that will make the course more accessible to you and/or other students.
If you need special accommodation, like extended exam time, please
submit requests for accommodations in writing with proof of College
support from the Office of Disabilities Service within the first two
weeks of class. Let me know if you need help with this process.


## Academic Honesty

Team assignments require collaboration amidst each team, but no
collaboration between teams is permitted without explicit permission. If you did not work in a team then you are not allowed to collaborate on the homework assignments. We use software to compare submissions, so please don't risk it. If
you're having significant trouble with an assignment, please contact me.

Please check the [Student
Handbook](https://www.smith.edu/about-smith/offices/student-affairs/student-handbook) to see the rules for Academic Integrity.

Just as you can do a google search for code online, it is trivial for us
to do the same. If you feel pressured about an assignment, please come
see me instead of cheating.
