# Q & A

  * Q: **When are the instructor's office hours?**
      * A: TBD (we'll define them using a poll and set 2 x 1-hour sessions; in addition, we can always meet over zoom with prior arangement or discuss over Slack).
  * Q: **Where are office hours?**
      * A: Ford Hall, Third Floor, Chemistry side, to the end: Office #316
  * Q: **What can I do if I am not free during office hours?**
      * A: we can set up an appointment to meet over zoom (usually 10 min). Also, there will be TA help available (TBD).
  * Q: **When are the TA's office hours?**
      * A: TBD.
  * Q: **Can I submit Homework Assignments late?**
      * A: Only with prior permission (Slack) given an explanation or because of emergency (e.g. health); HWs build on each other so the maximum extension is 4 days.
  * Q: **Can I complete a quiz late?**
      * A: Only with prior permission (Slack) given an explanation or because of emergency (e.g. health); Quizzes are used for attendance AND formative assessments so you only get 1 free late attempt.      
  * Q: **Can I submit reading exercises late?**
      * A: No (because they are needed before the lecture).
  * Q: **Will you record classes?**
      * A: No. 
  * Q: **Can I "attend" classes over Zoom?**
      * A: Only due to health reasons and with previous permission from the instructor. In addition, the instroctor will not manage the zoom call so you need to get a classmate to: 1) sit in front, and 2) manage the zoom call and your questions. I can lend that person a webcam for easy setup.
  * Q: **How is this class graded?**
      * A: The format is S/U (Satisfactory/unsatisfactory) but run as a traditionally graded course so that you get an S (Satisfactory) if you get a 70% or higher during the course and U (Unsatisfactory) otherwise. See details in the Syllabus.
  * Q: **Do I need a laptop?**
      * A: Yes; Mac or PC is ok (ipads are too weak and Chromebooks tend to be insufficient).
  * Q: **Do I need a to know some coding beforehand?**
      * A: No.      
  * Q: **What do I need to get started?**
      * A: Access to the [website](https://frankpablo.github.io/smith-site/docs/teaching/csc110home/), access to moodle for the course, access to the Slack workspace for the course.
  * Q: **What do I do if I am not officially registered (I don't have Moodle)?**
      * A: The course has a cap, and only if students leave will I let other students in. I will pick students based on the waitlist with no preference given to anyone.
